IIIT Delhi subscribes to the view that a **Masters degree** is primarily industry-focused. However, it can be used as a stepping stone for research as well. Whether they pursue the degree for skill and knowledge up-gradation or building research skills should rest with the student.
<br/><br/>

The institute feels the need to address the requirements of the industry, which are that of a more specialized workforce as each domain is growing more intricate. Thus, it is desirable to provide specializations within CSE in the M.Tech. Program. For this, the institute offers a student to do an **M.Tech.** or **M.Tech. with specialization**.
<br/><br/>

The following specializations are available:

- M.Tech. in CSE with specialization in [Artificial Intelligence](https://iiitd.ac.in/academics/mtech/ai)
- M.Tech. in CSE with specialization in [Data Engineering](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/academics/mtech/data-engg)
- M.Tech. in CSE with specialization in [Information Security](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/academics/mtech/info-sec)
- M.Tech. in CSE with specialization in [Mobile Computing](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/academics/mtech/mobile-comp)
- M.Tech. in CSE (without specialization)
  <br/><br/>
  **Note:** The seats will be allocated as open seats in the CSE program rather than specialization-wise.

IIIT Delhi will admit students to the core branch, i.e. CSE, rather than a specific specialization. The applicants are free to choose their specialization during their academic term. If a student completes the requirement of a particular specialization along with the requirement of M.Tech.(CSE) core/bucket, they are eligible to graduate with that specialization. The final degree is granted after due verification of completion of all requirements.
<br/><br/>

Particular requirements of each specialization are available [here](https://iiitd.ac.in/academics/mtech#programs).

<br/><hr/><br/>

## Eligibility Criteria

Both GATE and Non-GATE applicants with B.Tech./BE or MCA/MSc in CS/IT(& its allied areas) with 65% marks are eligible to apply for admission.

**For GATE Applicants:** A GATE score above the qualifying marks announced by GATE in the respective year will be considered valid. In addition, for CSE, the "CS" GATE paper will be considered.

<br/><hr/><br/>

## Important Dates

Visit the M.Tech. Admission home page for Important Dates. [Click Here](https://iiitd.ac.in/admission/mtech/2021)

<br/><hr/><br/>

## Application Procedure

1. **Apply online:** Fill up the M.Tech. The application form is available **[here.](https://admissions.iiitd.ac.in/IIITD)** (**Disclaimer**: TargetX hosts the application. IIITD has signed an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) with the service provider to protect the applicant's data. The applicant may fill the form only if they consent to this.)
2. A candidate will be eligible to apply for one category only, i.e. GATE or Non-GATE. If a duplicate is detected during the admission process, they will be considered in the GATE qualified applicants category.
3. **Application checklist**:
   - Read the instructions carefully.
   - Fill up the form online.
   - Pay the application processing fee of Rs.500/- (Additional Transaction Charges as applicable)

<br/><hr/><br/>

## Important Notes

**A. Converting CGPA to Percentage**

The application form will only ask for the aggregate percentage of the applicants.

- **If the applicant's institute provides percentage as the primary evaluation criteria:** Applicants should directly fill the percentage in the form. In this case, the applicant must give an undertaking form which is available [here](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/sites/default/files/docs/admissions/2021/Updated_Undertaking%20form_MTech%20AY%202020_IIITDV2.pdf).
- **If the applicant's institute provides CGPA or equivalent grading as the primary evaluation criteria:** The applicants with a grading scheme, i.e. result in CGPA or equivalent grading, should convert their CGPA to percentage according to the conversion formula of their institute. In addition, the applicant must upload a certificate on the official letterhead from the university/institute indicating the conversion from the CGPA to percentage.

**Note:** Suppose the applicant's institute does not provide a conversion from CGPA to percentage. In that case, the conversion formulae will be "multiplication of CGPA by 10" to derive the percentage. For example, for 7.5 CGPA, the equivalent in percentage will be 7.5x10 = 75%. In this case, the applicant must give an undertaking form which is available [here](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/sites/default/files/docs/admissions/2021/Updated_Undertaking%20form_MTech%20AY%202020_IIITDV2.pdf).
<br/><br/>

Applicants able to contact their institute over email or through any other medium are encouraged to get the same issued from their institute itself.
<br/><br/>

**Applicants facing challenges to get CGPA to percentage conversion certificate from their institute** due to the COVID-19 situation can give a self-undertaking at the time of application submission after carefully checking their institute's conversion rule. However, such applicants must submit the duly signed conversion certificate from their institute at the time of document verification. Failing to do so will make their admission liable for cancellation.
<br/><br/>

**B. Applicants who are students in their final year**

Applicants in the final year of their programs expecting to complete all their qualifying degree requirements before the registration date are also eligible to apply for admissions. We would consider their performance until the preceding semester (or preceding year if their programs are year-based) for shortlisting purposes. However, their admission would be provisional, subject to meeting the minimum eligibility criteria after the announcement of their final qualifying examination results.

<br/><hr/><br/>
