IIIT-Delhi subscribes to the view that a Master degree is primarily industry-focused, though it can be used as a stepping stone for research as well. The decision whether the degree is to be pursued for skill and knowledge up-gradation or also for building research skills should rest with the student.

<br/><hr/><br/>

## Objective

Program Objective of M.Tech.(CSE) program is to improve the following attributes in students:

1. An understanding of the theoretical foundations and the limits of computing.
2. An ability to adapt existing models, techniques, algorithms, data structures, etc. for efficiently solving problems.
3. An ability to design, develop and evaluate new computer-based systems for novel applications which meet the desired needs of industry and society.
4. Understanding and ability to use advanced computing techniques and tools.
5. An ability to undertake original research at the cutting edge of computer science & its related areas.
6. An ability to function effectively individually or as a part of a team to accomplish a stated goal.
7. An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.
8. An ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audience.
9. An ability to learn independently and engage in life-long learning.
10. An understanding of the impact of IT-related solutions in an economic, societal and environmental context

## General Requirements

- M.Tech (CSE) may be done with a thesis or without a thesis but with a scholarly paper. In both options, students have to do a certain amount of coursework. In addition, students doing M.Tech with thesis will have to do a thesis. Students without thesis option have to do additional courses, and instead of a thesis will have to do a scholarly paper.
- A student doing M.Tech with scholarly paper has multiple options for completing the scholarly paper requirement: a regular scholarly paper, industrial project and capstone project.
- The overall requirements are as follows:
  - **M.Tech with thesis:** 32 credits of coursework + 16 credits of thesis. At most 4 credits may be earned by doing 300 and 400 level courses.
  - **M.Tech without thesis:** 40 or 44 credits of coursework + 8 or 4 credits for a scholarly paper. At most 8 credits may be earned through doing 300 and 400 level courses.
- For the thesis or the scholarly paper credits, though the student has to register, he/ she need not be physically present and can do the work while being outside the Institute.
- A student admitted to the M.Tech program will give his/ her choice regarding which of the two options they want to pursue. However, this choice can be changed at any time during the program by suitably informing the PG Committee.
- Within the coursework requirement, each M.Tech(CSE) student has to earn 12 credits from core courses. The core courses comprise of one course (of 4 credits) each from the following groups (subject to change):
  - **[CSE519](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE319)**: Modern Algorithm Design
  - **[CSE511](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE511)**: Computer architecture
  - **[CSE503](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE503)**: Program Analysis
  - **[CSE523](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE523)**: Randomised algorithms
  - **[CSE535](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE566)**: Mobile computing
  - **[CSE508](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE508)**: Information Retrieval
  - **[CSE525](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE525)**: Graduate Algorithms
  - **[CSE538](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE538)**: Wireless Networks
  - **[CSE601](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CS301)**: Compiler
- All other courses are electives. In electives, at most 4 credits of **_Independent Study_** and 4 credits of **_Minor Project_** can be taken.
- Online courses may be permitted to be registered as Independent study/minor project with permission of PGC.

## Requirements for Specialization

- For “M.Tech in Computer Science with specialization in area”, from among the areas in which specializations are offered by the Institute, the student must:
  - Complete at least 16 credits of courses in the chosen specialization.
    - **[Courses for specialization in Artificial Intelligence](https://iiitd.ac.in/academics/mtech/ai)**
    - **[Courses for specialization in Information Security](https://iiitd.ac.in/academics/mtech/info-sec#courses)**
    - **[Courses for specialization in Data Engineering](https://iiitd.ac.in/academics/mtech/data-engg#courses)**
    - **[Courses for specialization in Mobile Computing](https://iiitd.ac.in/academics/mtech/mobile-comp#courses)**
  - Do their thesis or scholarly paper credits in that area. The advisor will certify this fact.
- If a course is in the list of courses for specialization, as well as in one of the groups for core courses, that course can be used for satisfying both the core and specialization requirements. However, the overall course requirements remain unchanged.
- If a student completes all requirements for the M.Tech, but not the requirements for specialization, they will be eligible for only “M.Tech in Computer Science”.

## Faculty

We have young and dynamic [faculty at IIIT-Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/people/faculty). A student can take elective courses offered by faculty members in different areas - [the focus areas](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/research). Most of the courses in Data Engineering will be taught by the following faculty members. In addition, there are plans to have some modules taught by experts from the industry.

## Internship

While an internship is not a requirement for the M.Tech. degree, students are encouraged to do an internship to gain industry experience. To facilitate internships, the institute has made arrangements with some corporations to host interns from this program. Guidelines are given [here](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/sites/default/files/docs/forms/Guidelines%20for%20Internship%20and%20Collaborative%20Thesis_12%20Jan%202021.pdf).
